      <h1>Julie K</h1>
      <p>Wow! So here we are! 10+ years after starting to use the internet, Julie finally publishes a page. Well, the first one she built totally by hand. One that's not a forum about Tamagotchis hosted by and built though through InvisionFree. Or even before that, MaxPages.</p>
      <p>Or, geez, even the basic coding that she copied for her Neopet's web page. Or her Yoshi-themed Myspace page. Or her first Tumblr blog in middle school.</p>

      <p>Anyway...enough about the past...here's a picture of a cat!</p>

      <img src="octocat.png" alt="The github octocat" />

      <p>I mean, at the end of the day, when you <strong>really</strong> think about it, what is the internet for, other than cat photos?</p>

      <p>Nothing, man.</p>
