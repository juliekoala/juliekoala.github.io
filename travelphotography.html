          <h2>Florida Everglades</h2>
            <div class="travelcaption">
              <p>This is an except from a short story Julie wrote about a trip into the Florida Everglades:<p>

                <p>"In November, I set off into the Everglades on my own, entering through the entrance in Florida City. My trusty steed carried my weight - three days of food and water, sleeping gear, bug spray, and sunscreen, among other gear. I aimed to bike to the tip of the park and hike the infamous Florida Coastal Trail.</p>

                <p>I got into my groove on my bike and pushed and pedalled my way the 50 miles to Flamingo Key and Campground, although it was still completely closed from Hurricane Irma the month before. There, I filled out a backcountry camping permit, scribbling with pencil, sealing it, and dropping it in the box. I wondered how often they checked that box.</p>

                <p>The sun was just beginning to set as I locked my bike to the trailhead sign and packed my overnight bag for the hike. As soon as I stopped moving on my bike, they came. Hundreds of them, covering every centimeter of uncovered skin I had. The mosquitoes.
