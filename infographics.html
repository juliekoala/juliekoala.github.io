            <h3>The Inner Workings of 'Hump' Classification Freight Yards</h3>
              <p>Rail freight in America carries hundreds of thousands of tons of bulk commodities, mail, and food products every day. Building these trains, averaging a mile and a half long, and getting each car where it needs to go is no easy mission. Freight trains are assembled, or ‘built’, in freight yards before being sent ‘over the road’ to their destinations. </p>
              <p>How are these 44-ton trains sorted and built so efficiently? One method is using a gravity-driven 'hump yard'. This graphic shows an overview of a typical freight yard and the different parts of the yard and shows an illustration of how train cars are sorted using the 'hump'.</p>
